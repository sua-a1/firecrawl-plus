pos-js is a Javascript port of Mark Watson's FastTag Part of Speech Tagger which was itself based on Eric Brill's trained rule set and English lexicon. It also includes a basic lexer that can be used to extract words and other tokens from text strings. Originally this was written by [Percy Wegmann](http://www.percywegmann.com/) and is [available on Google code](https://code.google.com/p/jspos/).

This fork adds TypeScript support to a fork made by [Darius Kazemi](https://github.com/dariusk) which added Node.JS and npm support.
