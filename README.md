# ðŸ”¥ Firecrawl

Crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. Built by [Mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai?ref=gfirecrawl) and the Firecrawl community. Includes powerful scraping, crawling and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in its early development stages. We are still merging custom modules in the mono repo. It's not completely yet ready for full self-host deployment, but you can already run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you'd like.

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev",
      "limit": 100,
      "scrapeOptions": {
        "formats": ["markdown", "html"]
      }
    }'
```

Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789",
  "url": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789"

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website:
scrape_status = app.scrape_url(
  'https://firecrawl.dev', 
  params={'formats': ['markdown', 'html']}
)
print(scrape_status)

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  'https://firecrawl.dev', 
  params={
    'limit': 100, 
    'scrapeOptions': {'formats': ['markdown', 'html']}
  }, 
  wait_until_done=True, 
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python

from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY", version="v0")

class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description="Top 5 stories")

data = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', {
    'extractorOptions': {
        'extractionSchema': TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema(),
        'mode': 'llm-extraction'
    },
    'pageOptions':{
        'onlyMainContent': True
    }
})
print(data["llm_extraction"])
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

```js
import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Scrape a website
const scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
});

if (scrapeResponse) {
  console.log(scrapeResponse)
}

// Crawl a website
const crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
  }
} as CrawlParams, true, 30) as CrawlStatusResponse;

if (crawlResponse) {
  console.log(crawlResponse)
}
```


### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```js
import FirecrawlApp from "@mendable/firecrawl-js";
import { z } from "zod";

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
  version: "v0"
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe("Top 5 stories on Hacker News"),
});

const scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl("https://news.ycombinator.com", {
  extractorOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },
});

console.log(scrapeResult.data["llm_extraction"]);
```
